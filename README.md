## Development
### 2/11/18
One of the goals for today was to be able to manipulate objects that get projected through AR. I was able to find an asset on the Unity store called [Lean Touch](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/lean-touch-30111) that does just this and more. At this current state, I can move objects and scale them around the AR marker.

Here's a screenshot of the current state. Users can click on as many cubes as they want and move/scale them to their liking.
